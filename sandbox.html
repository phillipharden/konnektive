                      It's been great working with these guys. We've watched
                      this system develop over the many years we've used
                      Konnektive. From its early beginnings, to what it is
                      today. We know of no other software CRM that intuitively
                      provides the necessary framework to allow success in the
                      world of Ecommerce and online payments. We highly
                      recommend their knowledgeable staff.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I've been running a combination of eCommerce and direct
                      response campaigns for 6 years and have been running my
                      business on Konnektive for 5 of those years. From a
                      revenue standpoint they can support any billing model you
                      can think of and support multiple post-cart one-click
                      upsell purchases that some other competitors would
                      normally charge fees for. Their 3rd party integrations and
                      plugins are VAST. From fulfillment, fraud protection,
                      email providers and call center technology, the ability to
                      get plugged in is typically only a few short clicks away
                      and adding in some API credentials.
                      <!-- They are also set up to support almost any payment gateway you can think
                        of...where a lot of others fall short or lock you into a specific processor or solution. As most business owners know, if you are lucky enough to experience success and growth, a lot of times that comes with outgrowing
                        your current infrastructure - whether its software, office, or people. On the software side, Konnektive has always been a step ahead in being able to help us with that growth in the world of e-commerce and Direct Response. -->

                      I own several businesses, all of which have benefited
                      greatly from Konnektive CRM. I had used just about every
                      other CRM out there and left them for failing in one area
                      or another. I've been using Konnektive for years and
                      haven't even thought about leaving. Their customer service
                      &amp; tech support have been there to resolve any issues
                      whenever I've needed them. I highly recommend Konnektive
                      to everyone.... well, everyone except for my
                      competitors... I don't tell them about Konnektive.

                      My business has been on Konnektive's Shopify Checkout for
                      the past 2 years and we could not be happier. The customer
                      service is great, but more importantly, the system is
                      built for us to continue scaling because of the smart
                      technology + integrations available to the customers.
                      Before joining Konnektive our customer AOV was $85 and
                      after the first three months on Konnektive, it was over
                      $140 and growing, allowing us to grow our business even
                      greater since we were able to create more revenue.

                    <p>
                      Konnektive has SAVED my business! We spent hundreds of
                      thousands of dollars trying to build our own CRM and it
                      doesn't even come close to the functionality and
                      integrations that Konnektive has. Their customer service
                      is always available, and we couldn't be happier. - Raphael

                    <p>
                      Konnektive is insane! I HIGHLY recommend it. Why...
                      because it does everything you could imagine for a
                      ridiculously low rate. Works great for Nutra and better
                      than Shopify and WooCommerce for single product ecommerce
                      sites. Tried Sticky and then quickly moved over, and so
                      glad I did. Couldn't recommend it enough!

                      I have worked with the Konnektive team for 10 years and
                      each year they continue to impress me with the most
                      functional products and innovative solutions for
                      advertisers and brand owners. <br />
                      <br />
                      Konnektive is one of the few partnerships that has
                      continued to grow and meet the needs of my changing
                      business over the years. The CRM is the most user friendly
                      I have used with robust reporting and with the recent
                      updates and additions it is my one stop solution for
                      everything I need to build pages and manage order flow for
                      my business.

                    <p>
                      My business has been on Konnektive's Shopify Checkout for
                      the past 2 years and we could not be happier. The customer
                      service is great, but more importantly, the system is
                      built for us to continue scaling because of the smart
                      technology + integrations available to the customers.
                      Before joining Konnektive our customer AOV was $85 and
                      after the first three months on Konnektive, it was over
                      $140 and growing, allowing us to grow our business even
                      greater since we were able to create more revenue.

                    <p>
                      Konnektive has SAVED my business! We spent hundreds of
                      thousands of dollars trying to build our own CRM and it
                      doesn't even come close to the functionality and
                      integrations that Konnektive has. Their customer service
                      is always available, and we couldn't be happier. - Raphael
